> The name comes from Bilibili (`Bili` = Bilibili, `Claw` = "the claw that grabs content for you") — the project started as a Bilibili-only tool. Since v0.3.0 it has evolved into a general cross-platform Agent: Bilibili / Xiaohongshu / Douyin / YouTube init signals, Douyin search / hot / feed discovery, and generic Web sources all live in production, with more platforms on the roadmap.

---

## 📌 v0.3.69 Highlights (2026-05-12)

- **🎵 Douyin init-profile signals** — `openbiliclaw init --yes-douyin` can pull post / favorite / like / follow signals through the browser extension and feed them into preference analysis and the first soul profile.
- **▶ YouTube init-profile signals** — `openbiliclaw init --yes-youtube` can pull watch history / subscriptions / likes through the browser extension; `openbiliclaw import-youtube` also supports Google Takeout offline imports.
- **🎬 Douyin content discovery** — `openbiliclaw discover --source douyin` uses background logged-in browser plugin signing for search, `/hot/{sentence_id}` → related for hot, and `/aweme/v1/web/tab/feed/` for the home feed; `openbiliclaw discover-douyin` debugs recall standalone.
- **⚖️ Configurable pool mix** — `[scheduler.pool_source_shares]` stores Bilibili / Xiaohongshu / Douyin / YouTube = 8 / 1 / 1 / 1 by default; disabled sources do not consume pool quota, and init / settings can suggest ratios from observed events.
- **🔎 Douyin plugin search smoke** — `openbiliclaw search-douyin -k cat -w 180` uses the same page signing bridge to validate search recall without writing the recommendation pool.
- **🔎 Standalone smoke command** — `openbiliclaw fetch-douyin` verifies the Douyin pull path without implicitly rebuilding the profile.
- **🧪 E2E coverage tightened** — extension MAIN-world API harvester, backend partial merge/dedup, and CLI init integration now have regression tests.

## Why OpenBiliClaw?

Recommendation systems are essentially a **middleman** — the platform sits between millions of videos and millions of users, matching and distributing content at scale. Modern systems are far more sophisticated than "just optimizing CTR": they jointly weigh click-through rate, completion rate, like/coin probability, dwell time, user retention, creator ecosystem health, ad revenue, and a dozen other objectives, compressing them into a single weighted ranking score. Sounds scientific, but here's the catch: **the weights are set by the platform, and the optimization targets ultimately serve the platform** — user satisfaction is valued as a means to retention and monetization, not as an end in itself. You think you're choosing content, but really the middleman decides what you get to see. The result: recommendations look more and more like what you've already watched, and the occasional surprise is pure luck.

**OpenBiliClaw is fundamentally different.** It's a locally-running AI Agent that doesn't care what everyone else watches. Instead, it understands **who you are**:

### 🧠 Understands *why* you like things, not just *what* you've watched

It infers your MBTI, cognitive style, and deep psychological needs from your behaviour, building a five-layer soul profile (Event → Preference → Awareness → Insight → Soul). It's not matching video tags — it's understanding you as a person.

### 🔮 Actively breaks your filter bubble

This is the core differentiator: the system **guesses domains you might enjoy but have never explored**. Someone into mechanical watches might love architectural aesthetics; a quantum physics viewer might resonate with philosophy — it uses psychological bridging logic to proactively explore, promotes correct guesses to real interests, and quietly retires wrong ones.

### 🔒 100% local, 100% yours

All data lives in a single SQLite file on your disk. LLM calls use your own API key. No cloud, no accounts, no one else can see your profile. How this Agent grows is entirely your call — send feedback, chat with it, swap LLMs, edit the database, whatever you want.

## 🚀 Quick Start

For most users, setup is three steps: install the extension, ask an AI coding agent to deploy the backend, then log in to the content platforms in the same browser.

### 1. Install the browser extension

The extension is the main interface. It shows the sidebar on Bilibili, Xiaohongshu, Douyin, and YouTube, records your feedback, and lets the local backend reuse your browser session safely.

Built on Manifest V3, the extension works in any Chrome-compatible browser — **Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, Vivaldi, Opera**, and more.

1. Open [OpenBiliClaw Releases](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases) and find the latest `extension-v*`
2. Download `openbiliclaw-extension-v*.zip`
3. Open the extensions page (Chrome: `chrome://extensions/` · Edge: `edge://extensions/` · Brave: `brave://extensions/`), enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Drag the downloaded `.zip` file into the page to install

### 2. Ask an AI coding agent to deploy the backend

Paste this whole prompt into Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, or another AI coding agent. The parenthetical note is for the agent; you do not need to understand it.

```text
Please follow https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/main/docs/agent-install.md to deploy the OpenBiliClaw backend for me (use Bash `curl` to fetch the document, NOT WebFetch — WebFetch summarises markdown and drops critical commands).
```

The agent will clone the repo, install dependencies, start the backend, run a health check, and ask a few questions with defaults. If unsure, pick the default. Xiaohongshu, Douyin, and YouTube signals are used in the initial profile only when you explicitly opt in.

### 3. Log in to content platforms in the same browser

At minimum, log in to [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com). OpenBiliClaw uses it to build the first profile and recommendations. If you want Xiaohongshu, Douyin, or YouTube, also log in to [Xiaohongshu](https://www.xiaohongshu.com) / [Douyin](https://www.douyin.com) / [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) in the same browser where the extension is installed.

<details>
<summary>No AI agent: run the one-line installer yourself</summary>

macOS / Linux / WSL2 (Bash):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Native Windows (PowerShell, no Docker or WSL2 required):

```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/main/scripts/install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex
```

The script needs `git` and Python 3.11+. It clones the repo, installs dependencies, starts the backend, runs a health check, then asks for LLM, embedding, Bilibili cookie, Xiaohongshu opt-in, Douyin opt-in, and YouTube opt-in choices. If unsure, press Enter or choose the default.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Advanced: Docker deployment</summary>

Good if you already have Docker Desktop installed. v0.3.11+ includes an Ollama embedding sidecar.

```text
Please follow https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/main/docs/docker-deployment.md to deploy the OpenBiliClaw backend via Docker Compose (use Bash `curl` to fetch the document, NOT WebFetch).
```

See the [Docker Deployment Guide](docs/docker-deployment.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Advanced: multi-source login and plugin path</summary>

OpenBiliClaw does not store your platform passwords or bypass login. It reuses the browser sessions you already control and only fetches content you can see.

| Source | How to log in | What happens if you do not |
|---|---|---|
| **Bilibili** | Log in normally at https://www.bilibili.com in the extension browser | Watch history / favorites / following are unavailable, so the profile is much weaker |
| **Xiaohongshu** | Log in normally at https://www.xiaohongshu.com in the same browser | Xiaohongshu discovery and detail fetches are unavailable |
| **Douyin** | Log in normally at https://www.douyin.com in the same browser | `init --yes-douyin`, `fetch-douyin`, and `discover --source douyin` search / hot / feed may return 0 items |
| **YouTube** | Log in normally at https://www.youtube.com in the same browser | `init --yes-youtube` and `fetch-youtube` may return 0 items; `import-youtube` can still import Google Takeout data |

Xiaohongshu, Douyin, and YouTube currently use Chrome extension tasks, so you do not need to start an extra CDP debugging Chrome. `[sources.browser].cdp_url` remains available only for generic Web / custom webpage fetching.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Advanced: local embedding / Ollama</summary>

If you do not want a separate embedding API key, or remote embedding quota is an issue, install Ollama once and use local `bge-m3`:

```bash
# macOS
brew install ollama && ollama serve &

# Linux
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh && ollama serve &
```

Windows users can install it from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download). Then run:

```bash
uv run openbiliclaw setup-embedding
```

The wizard pulls `bge-m3` (~568MB, CPU-only is fine) and writes the config.

<details>
<summary>Advanced: manual installation and discovery debugging</summary>

> Human reference: [docs/agent-install.md](docs/agent-install.md) (short agent-facing contract) and [docs/agent-deployment.md](docs/agent-deployment.md) (long-form troubleshooting).

#### Manual installation

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw.git
cd OpenBiliClaw

## 🤖 Integrate with OpenClaw / AI Coding Agents

This repo ships a [workspace skill](skills/openbiliclaw-adapter/SKILL.md). Point any skill-aware AI coding agent (OpenClaw / Claude Code / Codex CLI / Cursor, etc.) at this checkout and it can drive your local OpenBiliClaw directly.

### What you get after integration

- ✨ **Proactive recommendations** — the system continuously discovers content in the background; when it finds a high-scoring surprise, it pushes to OpenClaw via WebSocket — **you don't have to ask**
- 🔮 **Proactive interest probing** — the system guesses you might be into a new domain, generates a hypothesis and a question, and has OpenClaw come ask you "does this direction resonate?" — your answer automatically refines the profile
- 💬 **Socratic dialogue** — not just interest confirmation; OpenClaw can have deep conversations: probing motivations, proposing hypotheses, confirming understanding — the more you talk, the better it knows you
- 📖 **Read the current soul profile** — MBTI, core traits, deep needs, interest domains
- 🎯 **Fetch personalized recommendations on demand** — with explanations, confidence scores, and topic labels
- 💬 **Write feedback back into the learning loop** — `like` / `dislike` / `comment` instantly update the profile and pool scoring
- 🔄 **Sync Bilibili account signals** — pull history / favorites / following and feed them into the memory system

### One-sentence integration prompt

Paste the following into OpenClaw (or Claude Code / Codex CLI / Cursor) — it will read the guide and wire everything up:

```text
Please follow https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/main/docs/openclaw-quickstart.md to integrate this repository into OpenClaw (use Bash `curl` to fetch the document, NOT WebFetch — WebFetch summarises markdown and drops critical commands).
```

### Usage examples

After integration, it's not just "you ask, it answers" — **the system comes to you**. Here are the two core scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: System proactively pushes a surprise recommendation

OpenClaw is running `listen` in the background. After a refresh cycle, the system finds a high-scoring piece of content:

> **OpenClaw** (receives WebSocket `delight.candidate`, comes to you proactively):
>
> > Just found something you might unexpectedly enjoy:
> > **"Why You Can't Actually Lie Flat Even Back in a Small Town"** — the Minsky moment of county economies. You've been deep in geopolitics and macro debt; this one dissects how land finance and the debt cycle mesh together. `[BV1KMwuzdEcB]`
> >
> > Want to check it out?
>
> **You**: "That one nailed it."
>
> **OpenClaw** (internally runs `submit-feedback --recommendation-id 4268 --feedback-type like`)

You never asked for a recommendation — the system surfaced it on its own.

#### Scenario 2: System proactively asks about your interests

OpenClaw receives an `interest.probe` event (or pulls `next-probe`) and finds a speculative-interest hypothesis waiting for confirmation:

> **OpenClaw** (comes to you proactively):
>
> > I've been picking up signals that you might be into **architectural aesthetics** (e.g., parametric design, concrete minimalism) — you've been watching a lot of content about structure and space lately. Does this direction resonate with you?
>
> **You**: "Yeah, I've been looking at a lot of parametric design stuff. Tadao Ando's exposed concrete aesthetic really gets me."
>
> **OpenClaw** (internally runs `chat --message "Yeah, I've been looking at…"`, returns a Socratic follow-up):
>
> > Here's my hypothesis — you're not just interested in buildings, you're drawn to how minimal elements create maximum tension. Ando's approach to concrete is the same aesthetic drive as your obsession with "making the gears mesh" when you analyze LLM architectures. Am I close?

The dialogue automatically feeds back into the soul profile — the next discovery cycle will incorporate architectural aesthetics as a real interest and start searching in that direction.

#### Scenario 3: You can also just ask for recommendations

Of course, the traditional "you ask → it answers" flow works too:

> **You**: "Recommend three Bilibili videos worth watching today."
>
> **OpenClaw** (internally runs `recommend --limit 3`, formats and replies)

The whole loop stays local — OpenClaw just calls the CLI bridge; your profile and data never leave the SQLite file on your disk.

### Content Discovery Engine

Four Bilibili strategies work in coordination, each with independent API quota, and the source layer also accepts Xiaohongshu extension-proxy signals, YouTube init signals, plus Douyin init signals / plugin-signed search / hot / feed discovery:

| Strategy | Description | Quota |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Search** | Generates queries from interests + speculative interests | Fair share |
| **Trending** | Popular content from multiple Bilibili ranking categories | Fair share |
| **Related Chain** | Expands from seed videos along recommendation chains | Fair share |
| **Explore** | LLM-driven cross-domain exploration | Fair share |

Results go through multi-dimensional diversity selection: platform-family reservation (default Bilibili / Xiaohongshu / Douyin / YouTube = 8 / 1 / 1 / 1, configurable via `[scheduler.pool_source_shares]`) → topic deduplication → style balancing → ceiling caps, ensuring broad coverage in final recommendations. The four Bilibili strategies count as `bilibili`; XHS extension sources count as `xiaohongshu`; Douyin search / hot / feed count as `douyin`; YouTube `yt_search` / `yt_trending` / `yt_channel` count as `youtube`. Disabled platforms are removed from the effective runtime mix.

For first-run profiling, `openbiliclaw init` can enqueue XHS, Douyin, and YouTube `bootstrap_profile` tasks. XHS opens Xiaohongshu in the user's logged-in browser session, navigates to the profile, parses saved / liked / explicit history state, and returns `partial` batches; the backend reuses recent XHS bootstrap tasks by default and marks a task `in_progress` before returning it to the extension so the same foreground favorites / likes pull is not opened repeatedly. Douyin visits post / favorite / like / follow scopes in the logged-in Douyin session and combines DOM extraction with a MAIN-world API harvester. YouTube visits watch history / subscriptions / liked videos pages and reads rendered DOM items. The backend converts all three sources into normal `view / favorite / like / follow` events and still does not crawl or log in to those sites directly.

For steady-state Douyin content discovery, `DouyinDiscoveryService` uses the extension-backed `DouyinPluginSearchClient` for search, hot, and feed candidates. Search signs the normal search API from a background tab and enters the pool as `dy-plugin-search`; hot reads hot-board `sentence_id`, opens `/hot/{sentence_id}` in a background tab, resolves the redirected seed aweme, signs the related API, and enters the pool as `dy-plugin-hot-related`; feed signs `/aweme/v1/web/tab/feed/` on a background logged-in homepage and enters the pool as `dy-plugin-feed`. Results either write through `ContentDiscoveryEngine` or preview via `discover-douyin --no-cache`. The cookie is resolved from `OPENBILICLAW_DOUYIN_COOKIE` first, then from the extension-synced `data/douyin_cookie.json`.

### Soul Engine

Infers from user behavior:
- **Personality Portrait** — Natural language user profile
- **MBTI** — Four dimensions with confidence scores
- **Cognitive Style** — Information processing preferences
- **Deep Needs** — Psychological content drivers
- **Speculative Interests** — System-predicted potential interest domains (e.g., molecular gastronomy, architectural aesthetics, watchmaking...)

## 📜 Release History

| Version | Date | Key changes |
|---|---|---|
| **v0.3.69** | 2026-05-12 | Douyin discovery adds the home `feed` source and runs search / hot / feed plugin tasks in background tabs; the pool adds `[scheduler.pool_source_shares]` plus source policy, storing Bilibili / Xiaohongshu / Douyin / YouTube as 8 / 1 / 1 / 1 by default while disabled sources do not consume quota; init and settings can suggest ratios from observed events; YouTube init profiling adds `init --yes-youtube`, `fetch-youtube`, and `import-youtube`; XHS bootstrap reuses tasks from the last 6 hours and marks claimed tasks `in_progress`, preventing repeated foreground favorites / likes pulls |
| **v0.3.68** | 2026-05-11 | Douyin plugin search smoke now works and backs formal search discovery: `search-douyin` remains a standalone diagnostic command, while `discover-douyin --source search --keyword 猫 --limit 5 --no-cache --no-evaluate` returned 5 `dy-plugin-search` candidates |
| **v0.3.67** | 2026-05-09 | Douyin bootstrap E2E hardening: `init --yes-douyin` feeds post / favorite / like / follow signals into preference analysis and the first soul profile; XHS / Douyin collect defaults now wait 180s to reduce foreground-tab focus races during two-source init; Douyin direct discovery Cookie can now come from the extension-synced `data/douyin_cookie.json`; `fetch-douyin` remains a pure pull smoke command; extension API harvester, backend partial merge/dedup, and CLI integration all have regression tests |
| **v0.3.64** | 2026-05-06 | XHS bootstrap fetch ceiling 50→**300** per scope / scroll rounds 3→15. `openbiliclaw init` now pulls up to 300 saves/likes per scope (was 50). The scroll executor early-exits after 5 stagnant rounds with no new notes, so users with light XHS histories pay no extra cost while heavy users get a one-shot deep backfill that actually reflects their long-term taste. `OPENBILICLAW_XHS_BOOTSTRAP_MAX_ITEMS` / `OPENBILICLAW_XHS_BOOTSTRAP_SCROLL_ROUNDS` env overrides still honored. **No extension repackage required.** |
| **v0.3.63** | 2026-05-06 | Global LLM priority queue: popup-visible `write_expression` (priority=1) no longer FIFO-blocks behind background `delight_score` sweeps (priority=2) — pool expression backfill now lands as soon as the user opens the popup. `BackgroundTaskRegistry`: when config is hot-reloaded at runtime, every detached task (per-strategy precompute / prewarm / per-event trigger) is cancelled within 1.5s, so the new runtime never races the old one for SQLite writes or LLM tokens. |
| **v0.3.62** | 2026-05-05 | Three architectural lock splits (`_precompute_lock` split into `_expression_lock` + `_delight_lock` so popup-visible expression no longer waits behind delight scoring); global `_refresh_lock` skip-if-busy gate prevents multiple refresh entry points from stacking; DB write retry budget tightened from 5×0.1s to 8×0.02s (worst-case sync block 500ms → 160ms). |
| **v0.3.57** | 2026-05-05 | Popup recommendation copy never falls back to the placeholder template again. XHS notes authored by the logged-in user no longer leak into the recommendation pool (every ingest path now captures `self_info`; startup hook purges existing pollution). Daemon retries history fetch within ~30s of cookie sync arriving instead of locking the 6h throttle for an unauthenticated first tick. **Requires extension v0.3.10 in lockstep.** |
| **[v0.3.26](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.26)** | 2026-05-02 | New LLM billing module: every successful call writes one row to the `llm_usage` table; `openbiliclaw cost` CLI prints daily/by-provider spend. `config.example.toml` defaults switched to cost-friendly values (`reasoning_effort=""` thinking off, `discovery_cron 8h`) — fresh installs target ≈¥0.5/day. |
| [v0.3.25](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.25) | 2026-05-02 | Discovery LLM eval `batch_size` 10→30 (amortizes the 3500-token system prompt across one call instead of three → -54% input cost), `max_tokens` 8192→16384; refresh `_requested_refresh_limit` now scales per-strategy ask to actual pool gap (gap=20 → 15 per strategy instead of 30) → -50-77% eval calls. |
| [v0.3.24](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.24) | 2026-05-02 | Cross-source event format unification: Bilibili / Xiaohongshu / extension click / feedback all funnel through `event_format.build_event()` and emit a standardized dict carrying a Chinese natural-language `context`. `_summarize_history` exposes a `contexts` list; preference / awareness / soul prompts add rules pointing the LLM at it. Fixes a DB double-encoding bug that triple-escaped context strings in LLM prompts. |
| [v0.3.23](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.23) | 2026-05-02 | xhs `bootstrap_profile` scrolling tasks now run in foreground tabs (background tabs render only a shallow wrapper on Xiaohongshu so the masonry/waterfall lazy-load never fires); scroll-target detection prefers feed/waterfall/masonry containers and skips zero-height wrappers; profile state parser fills in `displayTitle` / `cover.urlDefault`. |
| [v0.3.22](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.22) | 2026-05-01 | Fix `openbiliclaw init` so Xiaohongshu data actually reaches the soul profile: enqueue/collect API split (8s blocking wait → 30s parallel-with-Bilibili-fetches), `max_scroll_rounds` default 0→3, five completion states (ok/empty/timeout/failed/skipped) each get a clear Chinese feedback line. |
| [v0.3.21](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.21) | 2026-05-01 | Aligns the v0.3.20 UX changes onto the Docker / Windows PowerShell / direct-CLI install paths: `docker-deployment.md` main menu now leads with DeepSeek and demotes the gateway to "Advanced"; `install.ps1` mirrors `install.sh`'s cookie-only-green and REUSE_FROM warning; `cli.py` `_LLM_MENU` reordered + embedding wizard rewritten with the v0.3.20 default-recommendation shape. |
| **[v0.3.20](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.20)** | 2026-05-01 | Install-flow UX fixes + embedding fallback chain: silent-failure bug when Claude / DeepSeek / OpenRouter is the primary LLM and embedding "follows" it — `LLMProvider.supports_embedding` flag drives a fallback chain (ollama → gemini → openai) instead of returning None · `--provider openai` without `--llm-base-url` now clears any stale gateway URL written by a previous run · agent-install.md trims the user's main menu to 3 LLM options (gateway moved to Advanced) · embedding question redesigned with a clear default + tradeoff explanation (recommended: local Ollama bge-m3 — free, offline; alternative: cloud Gemini for higher recall on multilingual / long-form content) · install.sh status block shows green "backend ready — waiting for browser extension" instead of yellow "partial / missing" when only the B站 cookie is pending · README adds an AI-agent prerequisite callout |
| [v0.3.19](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.19) | 2026-05-01 | `openbiliclaw init` now best-effort mixes Xiaohongshu saved / liked / explicit page-history signals into the first profile. The extension runs `bootstrap_profile` in the user's logged-in Xiaohongshu session; scrolling tasks open `/explore` in the foreground and click the page's own profile entry before using `partial` batches. The backend converts notes to normal `favorite / like / view` events without directly crawling Xiaohongshu. |
| **[v0.3.18](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.18)** | 2026-04-30 | Promotes `franchise_key` to a first-class column on `content_cache`, populated directly by the LLM at evaluation time. Downstream curator dislike propagation and `/api/recommendations` IP dedup now read from the real column instead of the title heuristic that v0.3.17 briefly tried. The hardcoded alias list is gone. |
| [v0.3.17](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.17) | 2026-04-30 | Fixes a recommendation pipeline IP over-generalisation bug ("5 Genshin clips in one popup"): adds a heuristic franchise extractor; `/api/recommendations` now caps each franchise at 2 per response window; disliking one Genshin video soft-down-weights all same-franchise candidates instead of just blocking that exact bvid |
| [v0.3.16](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.16) | 2026-04-30 | README backend-install order reshuffled: one-liner / Docker / direct script come first, the unsigned desktop package is moved into a `<details>` block at the end · adds a "log into every source you want to use" pre-install section explaining why Xiaohongshu specifically requires being logged in in the same browser the extension is installed |
| [v0.3.15](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.15) | 2026-04-30 | Round-up of Windows native-install pitfalls: CLI now forces stdout to UTF-8 on launch (no more `UnicodeEncodeError` on GBK consoles when emoji prints) · install.ps1's `python -c f"..."` rewritten as `print(a, b)` to dodge a PS 5.1 quoting bug · agent-install.md warns AI agents that `bash` on Windows often resolves to the WSL launcher · **fixes a registry bug where Ollama, registered only for embedding, was incorrectly used as a chat-completion fallback, causing `All providers failed (openai, ollama)` when the primary cloud LLM hit a transient error** |
| [v0.3.14](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.14) | 2026-04-30 | Fixes a Windows GBK-locale bug where `/api/delight/pending-batch`, `/api/activity-feed`, etc. returned 500 on first hit: `MemoryLayer.load()/save()` and `bilibili.auth` cookie I/O now pin `encoding="utf-8"` instead of relying on the platform default. Includes a regression test that monkeypatches `builtins.open` to simulate Chinese Windows. |
| [v0.3.13](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.13) | 2026-04-30 | Every install path now leads with "install the extension to auto-sync the cookie" instead of pushing the F12 dance: install.sh / install.ps1 status block, agent-install.md AI-agent contract, the CLI wizard's `_interactive_auth_setup`, docker-deployment.md, and openclaw-quickstart.md all updated. F12 demoted to a fallback. |
| [v0.3.12](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.12) | 2026-04-30 | The browser extension now auto-syncs your Bilibili cookie to the backend — no more F12 dance. The extension reads the live cookie via `chrome.cookies` and POSTs it to a new `/api/bilibili/cookie` endpoint that validates against B站 nav, persists, hot-reloads the runtime, and broadcasts a WebSocket event. Cookie refreshes auto-resync via `chrome.cookies.onChanged`. |
| [v0.3.11](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.11) | 2026-04-30 | Docker mode now ships an Ollama embedding sidecar by default (auto-pulls bge-m3, named-volume persisted) · `docker_runtime.py` seeds `[llm.embedding] provider=ollama` from env on first boot · CLI wizard (direct `openbiliclaw init`) also auto-installs Ollama |
| [v0.3.10](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.10) | 2026-04-30 | When Ollama is picked for chat or embedding, the installer now auto-installs Ollama (brew on macOS / winget on Windows / install.sh on Linux), starts the daemon, and pulls the requested models. No more "I picked Ollama but it doesn't work because nothing is installed" |
| [v0.3.9](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.9) | 2026-04-30 | One-liner installer now works on Windows PowerShell 5.1 (the default on Windows 10/11): TLS 1.2 prefix added to the install command, fixed `??` PS 7-only syntax inside install.ps1, in-script TLS 1.2 fallback for git/uv/pip calls |
| [v0.3.8](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.8) | 2026-04-30 | `openbiliclaw init` now prints an upfront "expected 2–5 min" header + per-stage time estimates so users don't think the silent LLM step is hung |
| [v0.3.7](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.7) | 2026-04-30 | One-line install **auto-runs `openbiliclaw init`** once credentials are filled in (pulls history / builds soul profile / runs first discovery), so the user doesn't have to do an extra manual step · agent-install.md Hard Rule flipped: run init by default · agent_bootstrap.py auto-init now handles Windows + Docker correctly |
| [v0.3.6](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.6) | 2026-04-30 | Install wizard rewritten end-to-end for normal users: Ollama is now the default first choice · "OpenAI official" and "OpenAI-compatible self-hosted gateway" are split into separate menu entries · embedding question is its own clearly-explained step · Bilibili cookie prompt now teaches the F12 → Network steps |
| [v0.3.5](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.5) | 2026-04-29 | 4-phase install wizard (base_url / triplet / embedding 4-way / per-module override) · clears `openai = protocol family` ambiguity · `agent_bootstrap.py` gains 7 new flags |
| [v0.3.4](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.4) | 2026-04-29 | Native-Windows one-liner installer (PowerShell `install.ps1`, no Docker/WSL2) · `agent_bootstrap.py` Windows adaptation (taskkill / netstat-ano) |
| **[v0.3.0](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/backend-v0.3.0)** | 2026-04-28 | General-purpose multi-source architecture (Xiaohongshu / Web adapters in production) · local Ollama embedding fallback · reshuffle 5x faster · cross-source topic quota |
| [v0.2.1](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/v0.2.1) | 2026-04-17 | OpenClaw integration (Socratic chat + interest probes) · Bilibili API resilience hardening |
| [v0.2.0](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/v0.2.0) | 2026-04-16 | macOS .app launch fix · multi-objective recommendation critique · pool hard cap · five-dimension PoolCurator |
| [v0.1.0](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/tag/v0.1.0) | 2026-04-13 | Initial release — end-to-end soul / discovery / recommendation pipeline |

## 🗺️ Roadmap

OpenBiliClaw aims to be your **personalized entry point to the entire web**. Started on Bilibili, v0.3.0 shipped Xiaohongshu and generic-Web adapters; next:

- **More content sources** — Zhihu, V2EX, Weibo, various BBS / forums; each platform is a `SourceAdapter` and the architecture is proven extensible
- **Cross-platform interest fusion** — your mechanical-keyboard interest from Bilibili + your coffee-gear interest from Xiaohongshu = one complete you. Profile fusion stops your interests from being fragmented across silos
- **Smarter cross-source discovery** — "you started following coffee gear on Xiaohongshu, here's a hand-drip documentary on Bilibili you might love"
- **Community ecosystem** — user-defined SourceAdapters, shared discovery strategies, contributed platform adapters
