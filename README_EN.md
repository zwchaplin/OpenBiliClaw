> The name comes from Bilibili (`Bili` = Bilibili, `Claw` = "the claw that grabs content for you") — the project started as a Bilibili-only tool. Since v0.3.0 it has evolved into a general cross-platform Agent: Bilibili / Xiaohongshu / generic Web adapters all live in production, with more platforms on the roadmap.

---

## 📌 v0.3.0 Highlights (2026-04-28)

- **🌐 General multi-source architecture in production** — evolved from a Bilibili-only tool into a general-purpose content Agent; Xiaohongshu and generic-Web adapters shipped
- **🔌 Local embedding fallback** — optional Ollama + bge-m3, no extra API key needed for similarity computation (CPU-only, works on Mac/Win/Linux)
- **⚡ "Reshuffle" 5x faster** — popup reshuffle from 2.6s → 0.6s; rapid clicks no longer feel laggy
- **🎯 Cross-source topic dedup** — any single topic capped at ≤10% of the candidate pool; no more "all AI all day"

## Why OpenBiliClaw?

Recommendation systems are essentially a **middleman** — the platform sits between millions of videos and millions of users, matching and distributing content at scale. Modern systems are far more sophisticated than "just optimizing CTR": they jointly weigh click-through rate, completion rate, like/coin probability, dwell time, user retention, creator ecosystem health, ad revenue, and a dozen other objectives, compressing them into a single weighted ranking score. Sounds scientific, but here's the catch: **the weights are set by the platform, and the optimization targets ultimately serve the platform** — user satisfaction is valued as a means to retention and monetization, not as an end in itself. You think you're choosing content, but really the middleman decides what you get to see. The result: recommendations look more and more like what you've already watched, and the occasional surprise is pure luck.

**OpenBiliClaw is fundamentally different.** It's a locally-running AI Agent that doesn't care what everyone else watches. Instead, it understands **who you are**:

### 🧠 Understands *why* you like things, not just *what* you've watched

It infers your MBTI, cognitive style, and deep psychological needs from your behaviour, building a five-layer soul profile (Event → Preference → Awareness → Insight → Soul). It's not matching video tags — it's understanding you as a person.

### 🔮 Actively breaks your filter bubble

This is the core differentiator: the system **guesses domains you might enjoy but have never explored**. Someone into mechanical watches might love architectural aesthetics; a quantum physics viewer might resonate with philosophy — it uses psychological bridging logic to proactively explore, promotes correct guesses to real interests, and quietly retires wrong ones.

### 🔒 100% local, 100% yours

All data lives in a single SQLite file on your disk. LLM calls use your own API key. No cloud, no accounts, no one else can see your profile. How this Agent grows is entirely your call — send feedback, chat with it, swap LLMs, edit the database, whatever you want.

> 💡 **How it compares**
>
> | | Bilibili Official | Keyword Filter Plugins | OpenBiliClaw |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | Recommendation logic | Collaborative filtering | Tag matching | Psychological profiling + 5-layer memory |
> | Filter bubble | Gets narrower | Doesn't address it | Speculative interests actively break it |
> | Data ownership | Platform-owned | Usually cloud | 100% local |
> | Explains why | "Guess you'll like" | None | Friend-like explanations |
> | Customizable | No | Low | Swap LLMs / edit profile / write Skills |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🧩 Step 1: Install the Chrome Extension

The extension is your main interface — it shows recommendations in a Bilibili side panel, collects behavior, and lets you chat with the agent.

1. Open [OpenBiliClaw Releases](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases) and find the latest `extension-v*` release
2. Download `openbiliclaw-extension-v*.zip` from that release
3. Open `chrome://extensions/`, enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Drag the downloaded `.zip` file into the page to install

> Developers can also `cd extension && npm install && npm run package` to build from source.

### ⚡ Step 2: Deploy the Backend

**⭐ Download the backend desktop package from Releases (recommended for most users):**

1. Open [OpenBiliClaw Releases](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases) and find the latest `backend-v*` release
2. Download the backend package for your OS:
   - macOS: `OpenBiliClaw-macos-*.zip`
   - Windows: `OpenBiliClaw-windows-*.zip`
3. Unzip it, launch the backend, then connect the extension to local `http://127.0.0.1:8420`

> ⚠️ The first desktop backend packages are unsigned. macOS may show Gatekeeper prompts and Windows may show SmartScreen warnings. If you would rather avoid OS security prompts, use the installer script or Docker paths below instead.

**⭐ Paste to an AI coding agent for one-click deploy (recommended — works with Claude Code / Codex CLI / Cursor etc.):**

```text
Please follow https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/main/docs/agent-install.md to deploy the OpenBiliClaw backend for me (use Bash `curl` to fetch the document, NOT WebFetch — WebFetch summarises markdown and drops critical commands).
```

**⭐ Have an AI agent deploy with Docker (recommended if you have Docker Desktop):**

```text
Please follow https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/main/docs/docker-deployment.md to deploy the OpenBiliClaw backend via Docker Compose (use Bash `curl` to fetch the document, NOT WebFetch).
```

**One terminal command:**

macOS / Linux / WSL2 (Bash):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Native Windows (PowerShell — no Docker, no WSL2 required):

```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/main/scripts/install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex
```

> The leading `[Net.ServicePointManager]...Tls12` lets PowerShell 5.1 (the default on Windows 10/11) successfully negotiate with GitHub. GitHub no longer accepts TLS 1.0/1.1 and PS 5.1 picks those by default. Users on PowerShell 7 can drop the prefix.

The desktop package is the easiest path for macOS / Windows users who want a click-and-go binary. The installer scripts (`install.sh` / `install.ps1`) are for developers and users who want a source-based setup. Prerequisites: `git` and `python3` (3.11+; on Windows the `py` launcher works). The scripts auto-clone the repo, install dependencies, start the backend, run a health check, and prompt you to choose an LLM provider (OpenAI / Gemini / DeepSeek / Claude etc.) and fill in the corresponding API key and Bilibili cookie. Once credentials are set, first-time init runs automatically (fetches history, builds your soul profile, fills the recommendation pool) so you're ready immediately.

> 💡 **On Windows?** Since v0.3.4 the PowerShell installer fully supports native Windows — no Docker / WSL2 needed. You can still use the Docker path above if you already have Docker Desktop installed.

> 🧠 **Optional: local embedding fallback (no API key required)** — install Ollama once:
> Mac `brew install ollama && ollama serve &`, Windows from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download), Linux `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh \| sh && ollama serve &`.
> Then run `uv run openbiliclaw setup-embedding` — the wizard pulls `bge-m3` (~568MB, CPU only) and writes the config. Useful when your remote embedding quota is exhausted, you're offline, or you just don't want to add another API key.

## 🤖 Integrate with OpenClaw / AI Coding Agents

This repo ships a [workspace skill](skills/openbiliclaw-adapter/SKILL.md). Point any skill-aware AI coding agent (OpenClaw / Claude Code / Codex CLI / Cursor, etc.) at this checkout and it can drive your local OpenBiliClaw directly.

### What you get after integration

- ✨ **Proactive recommendations** — the system continuously discovers content in the background; when it finds a high-scoring surprise, it pushes to OpenClaw via WebSocket — **you don't have to ask**
- 🔮 **Proactive interest probing** — the system guesses you might be into a new domain, generates a hypothesis and a question, and has OpenClaw come ask you "does this direction resonate?" — your answer automatically refines the profile
- 💬 **Socratic dialogue** — not just interest confirmation; OpenClaw can have deep conversations: probing motivations, proposing hypotheses, confirming understanding — the more you talk, the better it knows you
- 📖 **Read the current soul profile** — MBTI, core traits, deep needs, interest domains
- 🎯 **Fetch personalized recommendations on demand** — with explanations, confidence scores, and topic labels
- 💬 **Write feedback back into the learning loop** — `like` / `dislike` / `comment` instantly update the profile and pool scoring
- 🔄 **Sync Bilibili account signals** — pull history / favorites / following and feed them into the memory system

### One-sentence integration prompt

Paste the following into OpenClaw (or Claude Code / Codex CLI / Cursor) — it will read the guide and wire everything up:

```text
Please follow https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/main/docs/openclaw-quickstart.md to integrate this repository into OpenClaw (use Bash `curl` to fetch the document, NOT WebFetch — WebFetch summarises markdown and drops critical commands).
```

### Usage examples

After integration, it's not just "you ask, it answers" — **the system comes to you**. Here are the two core scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: System proactively pushes a surprise recommendation

OpenClaw is running `listen` in the background. After a refresh cycle, the system finds a high-scoring piece of content:

> **OpenClaw** (receives WebSocket `delight.candidate`, comes to you proactively):
>
> > Just found something you might unexpectedly enjoy:
> > **"Why You Can't Actually Lie Flat Even Back in a Small Town"** — the Minsky moment of county economies. You've been deep in geopolitics and macro debt; this one dissects how land finance and the debt cycle mesh together. `[BV1KMwuzdEcB]`
> >
> > Want to check it out?
>
> **You**: "That one nailed it."
>
> **OpenClaw** (internally runs `submit-feedback --recommendation-id 4268 --feedback-type like`)

You never asked for a recommendation — the system surfaced it on its own.

#### Scenario 2: System proactively asks about your interests

OpenClaw receives an `interest.probe` event (or pulls `next-probe`) and finds a speculative-interest hypothesis waiting for confirmation:

> **OpenClaw** (comes to you proactively):
>
> > I've been picking up signals that you might be into **architectural aesthetics** (e.g., parametric design, concrete minimalism) — you've been watching a lot of content about structure and space lately. Does this direction resonate with you?
>
> **You**: "Yeah, I've been looking at a lot of parametric design stuff. Tadao Ando's exposed concrete aesthetic really gets me."
>
> **OpenClaw** (internally runs `chat --message "Yeah, I've been looking at…"`, returns a Socratic follow-up):
>
> > Here's my hypothesis — you're not just interested in buildings, you're drawn to how minimal elements create maximum tension. Ando's approach to concrete is the same aesthetic drive as your obsession with "making the gears mesh" when you analyze LLM architectures. Am I close?

The dialogue automatically feeds back into the soul profile — the next discovery cycle will incorporate architectural aesthetics as a real interest and start searching in that direction.

#### Scenario 3: You can also just ask for recommendations

Of course, the traditional "you ask → it answers" flow works too:

> **You**: "Recommend three Bilibili videos worth watching today."
>
> **OpenClaw** (internally runs `recommend --limit 3`, formats and replies)

The whole loop stays local — OpenClaw just calls the CLI bridge; your profile and data never leave the SQLite file on your disk.

### Content Discovery Engine

Four strategies work in coordination, each with independent API quota:

| Strategy | Description | Quota |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Search** | Generates queries from interests + speculative interests | Fair share |
| **Trending** | Popular content from multiple Bilibili ranking categories | Fair share |
| **Related Chain** | Expands from seed videos along recommendation chains | Fair share |
| **Explore** | LLM-driven cross-domain exploration | Fair share |

Results go through multi-dimensional diversity selection: per-source reservation → topic deduplication → style balancing → ceiling caps, ensuring broad coverage in final recommendations.

### Soul Engine

Infers from user behavior:
- **Personality Portrait** — Natural language user profile
- **MBTI** — Four dimensions with confidence scores
- **Cognitive Style** — Information processing preferences
- **Deep Needs** — Psychological content drivers
- **Speculative Interests** — System-predicted potential interest domains (e.g., molecular gastronomy, architectural aesthetics, watchmaking...)

## 🗺️ Roadmap

OpenBiliClaw aims to be your **personalized entry point to the entire web**. Started on Bilibili, v0.3.0 shipped Xiaohongshu and generic-Web adapters; next:

- **More content sources** — Zhihu, V2EX, Douyin, Weibo, various BBS / forums; each platform is a `SourceAdapter` and the architecture is proven extensible
- **Cross-platform interest fusion** — your mechanical-keyboard interest from Bilibili + your coffee-gear interest from Xiaohongshu = one complete you. Profile fusion stops your interests from being fragmented across silos
- **Smarter cross-source discovery** — "you started following coffee gear on Xiaohongshu, here's a hand-drip documentary on Bilibili you might love"
- **Community ecosystem** — user-defined SourceAdapters, shared discovery strategies, contributed platform adapters
